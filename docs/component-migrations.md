# Component Migration Ledger

Append-only. One section per batch. Format: old path → new path | merged-into | deleted | consumers repointed.

## B2 — Sheet architecture

- components/patient/matching/SheetShell.tsx → components/phone/SheetShell.tsx | merged | consumers repointed (path swap)
- components/patient/onboarding/SheetShell.tsx → components/phone/SheetShell.tsx | merged | consumers repointed; prop tileTone renamed to tone
- components/professional/payouts/SheetShell.tsx → components/phone/SheetShell.tsx | merged | consumers repointed (path swap)
- components/admin/ui/BottomSheet.tsx → components/phone/SheetShell.tsx | merged as alias export BottomSheet | consumers repointed (path swap); self-controlled open mode preserved (dim + AnimatePresence embedded when open passed)
- components/admin/ui/SheetHeader.tsx → components/phone/SheetShell.tsx | merged as named export SheetHeader | consumers repointed (path swap); prop sub renamed to subtitle
- Canonical API: icon?, tone (TileTone), title?, subtitle?, onClose, footer?, children, open? (mount-controlled when omitted, self-controlled when passed)
- Deliberate normalizations: fixed h-[86%] frame everywhere (BottomSheet was max-h-[92%]); unified spring stiffness 380 damping 40 (BottomSheet was bounce 0.12 / 0.45s); footer top border dropped
- components/phone/Controls.tsx → deleted | superseded by components/phone/kit.tsx | 0 consumers (grep-verified)
- components/phone/ScreenBlocks.tsx → deleted | superseded by components/phone/kit.tsx | 0 consumers (grep-verified)

## B3 — Patient sheets onto canonical primitives

- components/phone/LifecycleButton.tsx → new | canonical idle→working→done footer CTA (tone: success/warning/danger/info, gated prop, CtaNote companion) | replaces 6 hand-rolled lifecycle footers
- components/phone/OptionRow.tsx → new | canonical selectable option row (OptionCheck companion, emerald/sky accents, icon/initial leading, radio/press roles) | replaces 5 hand-rolled option rows
- components/phone/DarkPanel.tsx → new | canonical dark inset panel (emerald/amber/rose, kicker, kickerTrailing, glow toggle) | replaces 6 hand-rolled dark panels
- patient/plan/FactRows.tsx → normalized | tone prop added (dark default unchanged, light added) | exported FactRow type
- Normalizations flagged: done-state unified to solid emerald-600; working text white/80; WhoSheet gains always-visible empty check track; WhoSheet rows px-3.5 py-3 → px-4 py-3.5; LanguageSheet rows gain whileTap; TimeSheet footer on LifecycleButton family shell; AddPrescription ledger preview orb unified to standard size; AddPrescription prescriber rows deliberately left custom (F12 decision)
- Preserved differences: WithdrawSheet rose panel glow={false} (original had none); CaregiverSheet footer loses duplicated ScrollText icon on second button (copy-paste artifact)
- Rewired: TimeSheet, WhoSheet, FiltersSheet, ServiceSheet, LanguageSheet, DoseDetailSheet, WithdrawSheet, LiveVisitSheet, AddPrescriptionSheet, CaregiverSheet, ConsentSheet, VisitSheet (12)
- Hairline row dividers removed from CaregiverSheet + VisitSheet light fact cards (no-divider rule)
- Verified: npx tsc --noEmit clean

## B4 — Professional/admin/system sheets onto canonical primitives

- components/phone/LifecycleButton.tsx → extended | tone 'accent' added (blue gradient house idiom from ConfirmWithdraw/CertificationUpload/EditProfile); gated style unified to bg-[#0B211B]/[0.08] text-[#0B211B]/40
- components/phone/FactTile.tsx → new | FactTile + FactTileGrid (2-col white fact tiles) | replaces 8 hand-rolled tiles across ConsentRecordSheet and AccessDetailSheet
- components/phone/MiniTimeline.tsx → new | dot-column timeline (done/pending/plain states, trailing slot, hairline connector) | replaces 2 hand-rolled timelines
- Normalizations flagged: dark-panel orb emerald-400/15 → /20 (payout trio); blue-idle done state → solid emerald-600; CtaNote absorbs footer notes (AccountSheet, CertificationUploadSheet, ConfirmWithdrawSheet)
- Preserved differences: EditProfile/CertificationUpload keep self-owned dim layers (parent AnimatePresence wiring untouched); FailureDrillSheet untouched (layoutId pill selector is unique); AccountActionsSheet untouched (rows defer to F5)
- Rewired: AccountSheet, ConfirmWithdrawSheet, PayoutReceiptSheet, CertificationUploadSheet, EditProfileSheet, ConsentRecordSheet, AccessDetailSheet (7); FactRows now imported cross-role (professional ← patient/plan)
- Repairs of pre-existing emit corruption: EditProfileSheet role card had malformed duplicate JSX; AccessDetailSheet header had garbled class string
- Verified: npx tsc --noEmit clean
